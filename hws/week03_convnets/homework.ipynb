    "## Tips on what can be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Network size__\n",
    "   * MOAR neurons,\n",
    "   * MOAR layers, ([torch.nn docs](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Nonlinearities in the hidden layers\n",
    "     * tanh, relu, leaky relu, etc\n",
    "   * Larger networks may take more epochs to train, so don't discard your net just because it could didn't beat the baseline in 5 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The main rule of prototyping: one change at a time\n",
    "   * By now you probably have several ideas on what to change. By all means, try them out! But there's a catch: __never test several new things at once__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "   * Training for 100 epochs regardless of anything is probably a bad idea.\n",
    "   * Some networks converge over 5 epochs, others - over 500.\n",
    "   * Way to go: stop when validation score is 10 iterations past maximum\n",
    "   * You should certainly use adaptive optimizers\n",
    "     * rmsprop, nesterov_momentum, adam, adagrad and so on.\n",
    "     * Converge faster and sometimes reach better optima\n",
    "     * It might make sense to tweak learning rate/momentum, other learning parameters, batch size and number of epochs\n",
    "   * __BatchNormalization__ (nn.BatchNorm2d) for the win!\n",
    "     * Sometimes more batch normalization is better.\n",
    "   * __Regularize__ to prevent overfitting\n",
    "     * Add some L2 weight norm to the loss function, PyTorch will do the rest\n",
    "       * Can be done manually or with weight_decay parameter of a optimizer ([for example SGD's doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.SGD)).\n",
    "     * Dropout (`nn.Dropout`) - to prevent overfitting\n",
    "       * Don't overdo it. Check if it actually makes your network better\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Convolution architectures\n",
    "   * This task __can__ be solved by a sequence of convolutions and poolings with batch_norm and ReLU seasoning, but you shouldn't necessarily stop there.\n",
    "   * [Inception family](https://hacktilldawn.com/2016/09/25/inception-modules-explained-and-implemented/), [ResNet family](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-resnet-and-its-variants-5281e2f56035?gi=9018057983ca), [Densely-connected convolutions (exotic)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993), [Capsule networks (exotic)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829)\n",
    "   * Please do try a few simple architectures before you go for resnet-152.\n",
    "   * Warning! Training convolutional networks can take long without GPU. That's okay.\n",
    "     * If you are CPU-only, we still recomment that you try a simple convolutional architecture\n",
    "     * a perfect option is if you can set it up to run at nighttime and check it up at the morning.\n",
    "     * Make reasonable layer size estimates. A 128-neuron first convolution is likely an overkill.\n",
    "     * __To reduce computation__ time by a factor in exchange for some accuracy drop, try using __stride__ parameter. A stride=2 convolution should take roughly 1/4 of the default (stride=1) one.\n",

    "     * Rotate+zoom(to remove black stripes)\n",
    "     * Add Noize (gaussian or bernoulli)\n",
    "   * Simple way to do that (if you have PIL/Image):\n",

    "     * and a few slicing\n",
